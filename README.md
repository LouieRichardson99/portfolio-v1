Hi, my name is Louie and this is my portfolio website repository!

I built my portfolio with the following technologies:

- Next.js
- Tailwindcss
- Prismic CMS
- Vercel hosting

I used these technologies to create a fast and good-looking portfolio to show off my projects I am working on.
Next.js was used to reap the benefits of server-side rendering to enhance SEO for my blog posts as they are picked up nicely by Google web crawlers.

Prismic CMS was used because of the clean and fast interface they provide to help me upload my content such as blog posts and project information like project descriptions and project hero images.

This website was designed in Figma. However, there have been some changes to the design along the way as I was coding it. These changes include having a better skills section to layout the skills in a more compact and readable manner.
